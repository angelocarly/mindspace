Capturing the mind

---

This is an attempt at a project I've been meandering over for the bigger part of a year. An attempt at a thought storage with ALL the whistles and bells. What it exactly is and will look like is unclear to me, but there are a lot of exciting parts to it. I'll treat the following as a memory dump:

1. A relational database containing floating thoughts and connections. Representing a mindmap. Hopefully a navigable space where connections and abstractions can be made and edited easily.
2. A CLI to interface with this database. Providing a simple way to rapid store thoughts and potentially also to navigate it.
3. A renderer to interface with this database.
4. A web UI to interface with this database.
5. An app to interface with this database. For very quick thoughts.

What parts of this excite me the most? That is the database and the renderer. However, note-taking would be important for gathering the data, so even though it is less exciting, some focus should go to making that easy to do.

## First steps

1. Setup a database (neo4j or memgraph)
2. Decide on how do connect/alter data
   - Make a CLI?
   - Make a web backend + site?
   - Make a renderer?

in parallel

- Experiment with thought formats and how to make it fun to use and alter
